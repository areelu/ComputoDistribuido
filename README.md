# Deaths by COVID 19 In the municipalities with the largest population in the state of Michoacán (2020, 2021, 2022)



# Introduction
Based on the sustainable development goals of the 2030 agenda given by the UN, of which Mexico signed, according to estimates the displacement for the coming years is an increase of the population to the cities, either in Latin America, Europe, Asia. Leaving rural areas empty with the belief that the city is a better place to live. 
Given these predictions the following questions arose: In the context of the COVID 19 pandemic, which originated in China in 2019 and continued in 2020 and 2021.

Where is there higher mortality, rural or urban?
Weighing the readings from the UN reports. 

We narrowed the information to the most populated municipalities in the state of Michoacán, since that is where there is a greater amount of data for our project.

Our team came up with an idea of how this pandemic, which was an atypical event, not contemplated or an imponderable, we delimited it to a local context that could contribute to people knowing that a development in quality of life affects the mortality of this pandemic.
